### User Status

We communicate a number of different user states through our API. At a high-level accounts can be in one of four states:

* **pending** - This state is present while the user is creating an account
* **restricted** - When a user is in this state they are allowed to login to the application and receive money, but they are not permitted to initiate transactions. This states exists to allow members to satisfy additional data requirements.
* **blocked** - This state is present when a user has violated our terms of service. In this state users are unable to login or access the product.
* **ok** - Everything is ay-ok.

When members are in restricted or blocked state, the `flags` field can help communicate the reasons for account suspension. These flags, and their permissible values are:

Flag | Permissible Values | Description

registration | pending, running, ok | Where a user is in the registration process.

message | A message or note provided by the user at the time the transaction was initiated, with the intent of communicating additional information and context about the nature/purpose of the transaction.
status | The current status of the transaction. Possible values are: `pending`, `waiting`, `cancelled` or `completed`.

<aside class="notice">
A transaction can involve 3 different currencies: the currency as **denominated** by the user, the currency at the **origin** card and the currency at the **destination** card. For instance, _"transfer 1 BTC from my USD card to my EUR card"_. In this case, 1 BTC would be the denominated amount, but the equivalent in USD is credited at the origin, then debited in EUR at the destination.
